# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Background:

In the fiercely competitive telecom industry, where customers frequently switch between service providers, a churn rate of 15-25% annually is common. Given the high cost of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones, customer retention has become a top priority for telecom companies.

Business Objective:

The primary objective for many telecom operators is retaining high-profit customers. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to predict which customers are likely to churn. In this project, customer-level data from a prominent telecom firm will be analyzed to create predictive models that can identify customers at a high risk of churning.

Project Focus:

The focus of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model. This model will use provided usage features to identify customers who are likely to churn. The ultimate goal is to enable telecom companies to proactively retain valuable customers and reduce churn rates.
